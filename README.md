# Rladies_blog_post1
This post is a contribution for Rladies SP blog. Here I use the tidytuesday dataset launched 2021-08-03, about paraolympics. 

The idea is to play around with tidyverse and ggplot2 packages, to educate and motivate begginers. This one is specially cool, because I could play around with _Poisson regression._
